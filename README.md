Validation: Schoolap provides input validation and data integrity checks to ensure that the data being stored is accurate and complete.

Authentication: The app supports user authentication, requiring users to log in with their username and password before accessing any resources.

Technologies Used
SOAP: Schoolap is built on top of the SOAP architecture, which allows for easy integration with other systems.

MySQL: Schoolap uses a MySQL database to store all the data, ensuring that the app is scalable and reliable.
